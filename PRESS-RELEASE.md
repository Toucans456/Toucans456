#  Recipe Archive: Digitize Your Dinner #

## Capture Recipe. Add Tags. Get Cooking. ##

## Summary ##
    Our recipe archiver allows users to upload and save photos of their handwritten recipes, as well as add a name and tags to each.
    The user can then use our search functionality to
    view recipes by recipe name or tag.
    Our purpose is to take grandmother's old analog recipes and digitize them, preserving them for future generations.
## Problem ##
    Have a ton of old handmade cooking recipes passed down from generations?
    That book of recipes is most likely falling apart and won't last forever.
## Solution ##
    Use our app to save and share your family legacy in one place!
## Team Toucans says ##
